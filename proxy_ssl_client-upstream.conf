# Snippet to be included in a reverse proxy server to catch the custom SSL_* headers
# (which will be seen as HTTP_SSL_* in the upstream) during the SSL verification process
# performed in the same proxy server, These headers should be transformed back
# to SSL_ for the web app, by using the corresponding
# $http_* variables generated by nginx. The web app should take care of
# SSL_* headers only.

# This is to prevent a warning about the bucket size
#proxy_headers_hash_bucket_size 128;

# And the set of headers, trying to mimic as much as possible the same headers
# that Apache generates via StdEnvVars and ExportCertData options in a SSLOptions directive
